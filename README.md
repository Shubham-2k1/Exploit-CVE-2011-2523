**Description**
This script exploits a backdoor vulnerability in VSFTP version 2.3.4. Here's how the exploit works:

Triggering Backdoor: The script connects to the VSFTP server and checks its version. If the version matches 2.3.4, it sends specially crafted USER and PASS commands to trigger the backdoor.

Obtaining Shell Access: After successfully triggering the backdoor, the script establishes a connection to the backdoor port (6200) and gains shell access to the target system.

**Notes**
Target Compatibility: This exploit script specifically targets VSFTP version 2.3.4. Ensure that the target system is running this exact version for the exploit to work.

Security Implications: Using this script to exploit vulnerabilities in systems without proper authorization may be illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions before using this script in any environment.
